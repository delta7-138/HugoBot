# Hugo Bot 
This discord bot does cool stuff like randomly generates a color, generates random names and sends pictures of the Martian surface as taken by the Curiosity rover. 

Will keep adding functionalities as and when I get more ideas. 

## +randomname (alias : +rand)
To randomly print message

## +hello
To greet 

## +color
Randomly generate color

## +mars {sol}
On Entering sol number for Curiosity rover by NASA you get the image captured on that sol by the rover. Uses NASA API
